# Zephyr_ECG_Summary_Glucose data processing

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive suite for []. It is structured in a series of steps, each encapsulated in individual Python scripts, to provide a modular and easy-to-understand approach to create datasets to feed to DL networks. The repository contains code for the Sense Project. Contains code from reading the ECG-Sumamry file from Zephyr folder and then processing it with reading glucose file. The code contains all necessary functions from reading to creating a dataset before feeding to CNN and RNN networks
